# Korean null subjects and machine translation

This repository contains a small dataset and analysis materials for a qualitative study on reference resolution in Korean null-subject constructions.

The data compares expected human interpretations with English outputs from Google Translate and Naver Papago, focusing on how implicit subjects are resolved or over-specified in translation.

The examples and error categories are based on my paper analyzing discourse, pragmatic, and honorific cues in Korean.
